SIMS - Souvenir in Moments

My goal with SIMS is twofold: to capture the essence of human movement and to democratize the creation of personalized art. Utilizing motion capture technology, I intend to precisely translate dynamic gestures into 3D-printable souvenirs. This process not only preserves the beauty of fleeting moments but also empowers individuals to engage with digital fabrication in a meaningful way. 

The methods combine expertise in computer vision, 3D modeling, and additive manufacturing to streamline the creation of personalized artifacts. The motion outline capture algorithm is done by merging the marching squares technique and hatching on p5.js. While the algorithm is capturing frame by frame outline, the code will translate every frame to G-Code, the only extension accepted by the 3d printer, to sculpt the received outlines. By integrating these technologies, I intend to bridge the gap between digital and physical realms, offering a novel approach to artistic expression and real-time capture. 

My goal with SIMS aligns with the ethos of my studies as an ETB student at CMU's BFA program. Through this project, I aim to bridge the realms of digital art, interactive installation, and technology-driven expression. By utilizing motion capture technology and real-time 3D printing, I'm exploring innovative avenues within electronic art and media.
